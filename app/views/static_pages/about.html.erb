<h1>How Anchorage.io Works</h1>

<p>Anchorage.io is an open-source, community-powered cruising guide that draws upon the extensive knowledge of cruisers, boat people, pirates, fishermen, racers, and other seafaring folk. Our goal is to provide world-wide coverage of anchorage, marina, harbor destinations. The following guide will explain get the most out of the application as a user and a contributer. </p>

<h2>Sign Up for Free</h2>

<p>You can surf around the site all you want without signing up, but creating a free account will help you get the most out of app. The only required info is an email address. <%= link_to "Sign up now", signup_path, remote: true %></p>

<h2>Cruising Guides</h2>

<p>Users have the ability to create an unlimited number of custom cruising guides. Each page in your cruising guide represents an anchorage or marina that you’ve picked out from this site. </p>

<p>You add pages to your cruising guide by clicking the on buttons that look like this:  <div class="btn-group btn-sm">
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-success dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Cruising Guides  <span class="caret"></span></a>
</div>
</p>

<p>After you’ve signed up, your account will be setup with a custom cruising guide called <strong><i></i class="fa fa-book"> My Cruising Guide</strong>. This is your default guide, but you can create additional guides as needed. Maybe you want one guide for Puget Sound and another for the Sea of Cortez. </p>

<h2>Anchors <i class="fa fa-anchor text-success"></i></h2>

<p>Think of anchors as the equivalent to Facebook likes, upvotes, stars, hearts, etc. — but with one special caveat. Any user experience or Photo that you "anchor" will be included in your custom cruising guide. For instance, if you have the Smugglers Cove page added to your cruising guide, it will only include the locations's primary details. Anchoring images and experiences you find useful will add additional custom content to your guide. </p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>The real power of Anchorage.io comes from the shared knowledge of our users. Any user can share two different types of information about a given location - images and experiences. In either case, you should share information that is useful to other cruisers, including topics like nearby facilities, weather protection, holding ground, wildlife, etc. Sharing highly opinionated ideas is discouraged. </p>

<p><strong>Share your Blog</strong> - Cruising blogs are packed full of interesting and useful information. We encourage you to link back to your blog, just don’t spam it. Make sure to update your profile with your blog's backlink.</p>

<h2>Badges and Rewards</h2>

<p>Badges are awarded to members automatically when they reach certain milestones, such as sharing a certain number of experiences and having their content anchored by other users. Check out the <%= link_to "full list of badges", badges_path %>.</p>

<p>We also give out REAL rewards to our exceptional and just plain lucky members, such as T-Shirts, Hats, Gift Cards, etc. </p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>Our goal is to create a dynamic and comprehensive source of information for boaters. Whether you're daysailing to Catalina or making a circumnavigation, the purpose of this site is to supplement nautical charts and paper cruising guides with continually updated first-hand knowledge.</p>
